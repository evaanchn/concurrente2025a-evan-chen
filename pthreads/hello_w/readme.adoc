== Problem statement

Modify the "hello world" program to create an arbitrary number of threads. Each thread prints "Hello from secondary thread {i}" to standard output and terminates. Allow the user to specify the number of threads as a command-line argument. If this argument is omitted, assume the number of available CPUs on the system.
