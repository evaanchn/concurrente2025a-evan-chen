[[problem_statement]]
== Problem statement

Modify the "hello world" program to create an arbitrary number of threads. Each thread prints "Hello from secondary thread {i}" to standard output and terminates. Allow the user to specify the number of threads as a command-line argument. If this argument is omitted, assume the number of available CPUs on the system.

[[hello_count]]
== Hello Count
On my *Fedora 40 64-bit* virtual machine, the maximum amount of threads is around *14,000* threads, a number discovered by executing the program with different numbers. The PTHREADS_THREAD_MAX constant does not seem to exist.
