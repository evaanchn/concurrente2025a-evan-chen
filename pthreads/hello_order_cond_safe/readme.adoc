Have a team of threads greet in order. That is, if w threads are created, the output is always in order.

[example]
====
Hello from thread 0 of w

Hello from thread 1 of w

Hello from thread 2 of w

...

Hello from thread w of w

====
Avoid concurrency control if possible, that is, try to use conditional safety
