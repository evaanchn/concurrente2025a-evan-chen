Make the threads greet in order, just like Example 7 (hello_order_semaphor). This implies that if w threads are created, the exit will always be in ascending order, like so:

[example]
.Output format
====
Hello from thread 0 of w

Hello from thread 1 of w

Hello from thread 2 of w

...

Hello from thread w of w
====

Evite (si es posible) el control de concurrencia, es decir, trate de usar seguridad condicional (conditionally safe).
