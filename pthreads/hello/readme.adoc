== Problem statement

Write a program that creates two threads when executed: main and secondary. Both threads must greet with "Hello from main thread" and "Hello from secondary thread" messages in the standard output, respectively. Use a dynamic analizer of the code like the _memcheck_ and _helgrind_ (from Valgrind) tools, or Google Sanitizers to ensure the program does not provoke race conditions.
