Have a team of threads always greet in order. That is, if `w` threads are created, the exit will always be in order.

[example]
====
Hello from thread 0 of w

Hello from thread 1 of w

Hello from thread 2 of w

...

Hello from thread w of w
====

Use a collection of semaphores as a synchronization mechanism (concurrency control).
