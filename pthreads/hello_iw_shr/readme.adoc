== Problem statement

Create a new version of "numbered hello world" program where each thread prints "Hello from secondary thread {i} of {w}", in which i is the thread number and w is the total number of threads in the team, but with the following changes:

Place the shared data for all threads (the number w) in a shared register (structure) for each thread. Keep the unique data for each thread (i) in a private register.

Report the duration in seconds that threads take to say hello. You can use the POSIX clock_gettime() function from <time.h>.
